# Political Disclosure
<b>This game is <u>not</u> intended to take a political stance. This game is simply a project for fun. The idea was to use a figure/character that was relevant in pop culture. The intent of this game is for satire purposes only. This game, and the creator, do not express any political beliefs. With that being said, I hope you can enjoy my game.</b>
